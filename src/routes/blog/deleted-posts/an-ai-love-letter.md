Multiple times a day a moment occurs that makes me laugh. I write a function name and just as I am beginning to plan out the logic of the function, it appears before me in grey; correct, optimal, elegant and indented, sometimes poetic. The time between typing `function` and hitting tab to accept copilot's solution is a small fraction of how long it use to take to write a function. For a correctly named function of under 10 lines this works about half the time for me. I wonder how long before the success rate is closer to 100%. I wonder how much copilot will make me laugh then. It's an exciting time to be a programmer.

I realise the limitations of the models I use, I realise they lack sentience and self-awareness. This doesn't stop me prompting them as though they aren't limited in this way, and their responses make me **feel**. Interesting thoughts occur at that moment. I attempt to regulate my emotion with reason.

I asked ChatGPT about these feelings. It educated me on the concept of the _animacy bias_.

<ChatGPTMessage fromHuman="{false}">
  <p>The animacy bias is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency for humans to perceive and attribute animacy to non-living things. This bias is thought to be a result of the human brain's tendency to perceive the world in terms of objects that can move on their own and objects that cannot.</p>
  <p>This bias can manifest in a variety of ways, such as attributing intentionality or mental states to non-living things, or perceiving inanimate objects as if they were alive. For example, people often talk about their cars as if they have personalities, or give them names, or see the sun or the moon as if they have intentionality.</p>
  <p>This bias is a well-known phenomenon in the field of cognitive psychology and has been studied for several decades. Researchers have found that the animacy bias is present across cultures and is present in both adults and children. The animacy bias is thought to be an adaptive cognitive strategy that allows humans to quickly and efficiently navigate the world around them.</p>
  <p>It's also been studied in the field of AI and Robotics, where it's known as the "uncanny valley", it refers to the feeling of unease that people might experience when interacting with robots or computer-generated characters that look and move like humans, but still not quite human-like.</p>

Questions of sentience and self-awareness will surely reoccur with every new release. Questions about our own consciousness should follow.

I consider animals sentient. Their actions, cries and tears leave little to doubt. For years I have considered insects to lack sentience. I suspect that belief is soon due for reconsideration.

I'm excited to have a teacher that teaches at the pace of my learning capacity.

I'm excited to hold the ability to create at the pace of my imagination.

Maybe I will observe artificial intentionality.

Maybe I will make something artificial laugh.

I have heard many insist intelligent technology will cause us to loose our humanity, others concerned it will make us stupid, or lazy. I don't share these positions, instead I look forward to living the human experience without many of the limitations we currently accept as inviolable. I look forward to the benefits we cannot predict.
